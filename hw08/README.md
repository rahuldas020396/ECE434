5.3 PWM Generator
--------------------
The pin is toggling at 50.0MHz and is quite stable. It has a 
standard deviation of 376kHz which is 0.75% deviation

5.4 Controlling the PWM Frequency
---------------------
fastest we can make it toggle is a period of 80ns which is a frequency of 12.5MHz.
There is a considerable amount of jitter however the frequency is stable.

5.9 Reading an Input at Regular Intervals
----------------------
I attempted to catch the edge on the scope but was unable to do so.
I am unsure as to how the transition can be captured. 
When I trigger the scope on an edge and zoom in, I notice that the edge is not straight.
